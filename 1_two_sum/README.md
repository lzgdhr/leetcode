# leetcode
For this problem, 2 different approaches are used. 

1. Iterating the list using 2 loops. Time complexity is O(n^2). 
 
2. Iterating the list using 1 loop. Time complexity is O(n) cos dict search is O(1). 

Lesson learnt: Python dict implementation is very time-efficient at a slight cost of space complexity. Use dict to simplify loop structure if memory is sufficient.
